    1. Start Fresh — Clean Environment

    Ensure your virtual environment is activated:
    source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    # or

    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell

    Make sure all dependencies are installed:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    2. Environment Variables

    Confirm .env file has your keys and credentials:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
    STREAMLIT_AUTH_USERNAME=admin
    STREAMLIT_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password_here

    Verify .env is loaded by your app (load_dotenv()).

    3. Ingest Your Documents (PDFs / URLs)

    Run ingestion script to load your source documents into vector store:
    python modules/rag_ingest.py

    Confirm ingestion logs print “Ingestion complete and vector store persisted.”

    4. Run the Streamlit App

    Start your Streamlit app with:
    streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py


    Or if your main Streamlit file is different (e.g., main.py), use that instead.

    5. Demo Flow Inside Streamlit UI

    Login:
    Enter username and password from .env.
    Confirm login success or error on invalid creds.
    Ask Questions:
    Input natural language questions related to your ingested documents.
    Watch the “Thinking…” spinner and then see the answer + sources displayed.

    Logout:
    Click the Logout button.

    Confirm you’re back to login screen, ready for next user/demo.

    6. Test Edge Cases
    Try a math expression (if calculator module is integrated).
    Try a search query (if web search module is active).
    Ask about a topic not covered in your documents — see how it responds.
    Try invalid login creds and observe error handling.

    7. Wrap Up
    Stop the app with Ctrl+C.
    Optionally, demo Docker containerized run if you set it up:
    docker build -t ai-agent-mcp .
    docker run -p 8501:8501 ai-agent-mcp
