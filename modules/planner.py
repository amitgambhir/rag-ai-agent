# planner module
# modules/planner.py

# Placeholder for future planner module
# This could implement a Plan-and-Execute strategy or a TaskGraph

# Later on, if we go the LangGraph route, we might do something like:
# from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
# from langchain_core.runnables import Runnable
# More planning logic to come here...
